Currently, I'm involved in developing three applications that address specific needs in different sectors. My pet data app,
Fetcher, is designed with user-friendliness in mind. I'm also working on a unique application for the
Non-Emergency Medical Transportation (NEMT) industry, as well as a venue management software specially designed for wedding venues.
These projects reflect my ability to adapt my technical skills to a diverse range of needs and industries.
